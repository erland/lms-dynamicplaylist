5. USAGE
========
This plugin makes it possible manage all dynamic playlists in the same menu on the
Squeezebox and in the same list in the slimserver web interface. The plugin today implements
Random Mix playlists connection and a connection to saved playlists so they are
showed among the dynamic playlists.

You can implement your own dynamic playlists by implementing the methods described below
in your plugin. The plugin must be enabled for it to be detected by DynamicPlaylist plugin.

# Returns a map with a an entry for each playlist, 'myplugin_mycoolplaylist' in the sample below
# The playlist entry must contain a 'name' but it can also contain additional items which you
# need later when tracks are requested for the playlist
# This method will be called by the DynamicPlaylist plugin whenever the playlists shall be shown
sub getDynamicPlayLists {
	my ($client) = @_;

	my %result = ();
	my %playlist = (
		'name' => 'My Cool Playlist'
	);
	$result{'myplugin_mycoolplaylist'} = \%playlist;
	return \%result;
}

# Returns the next tracks, this method will be called by DynamicPlaylist plugin when more tracks are needed
# playlist = This is the same map for the playlist as you returned in the getDynamicPlayLists method
# limit = The number of tracks that should be returned
# offset = The offset of the track from the beginning of the playlist
sub getNextDynamicPlayListTracks {
	my ($client,$playlist,$limit,$offset) = @_;

	my @result = ();
	my $items = $ds->find({
		'field'  => 'track',
		'find'   => {'audio' => 1},
		'sortBy' => 'random',
		'limit'  => $limit,
		'cache'  => 0,
	});

	for my $track (@$items) {
		push @result, $track;
	}
	return \@result;
}
